The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build is failing at the "build.command" stage with exit code 127, specifically because the command `npm run build` is unable to find the "vite" package as indicated by the error `sh: 1: vite: not found` (#L55).

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the "vite" package is listed as a dependency in the project's `package.json` file or was committed to the repository.
2. If "vite" is missing, add it to the project's dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install vite --save-dev
   ```
3. Ensure that the "vite" package is correctly installed and available in the project before running the build command again.
